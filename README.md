# 100W ZVS Driver Circuit

Created to power a second generation 50kV high voltage power converter, this ZVS is currently being tested in an induction heater.
It provides a much more efficient alternative to pulsing a MOSFET when it comes to driving a coil.
This will greatly improve the efficiency of the high voltage power converter.
