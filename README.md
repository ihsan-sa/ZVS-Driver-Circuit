# 100W ZVS Driver Circuit

Created to power a second generation 50kV high voltage power converter, this ZVS is currently being tested in an induction heater.
It provides a much more efficient alternative to pulsing a MOSFET when it comes to driving a coil.
This will greatly improve the efficiency of the high voltage power converter.

The folowing pictures show the ZVS Driver PCB testing. The first oscilloscope image shows the current in the the ZVS driver coil at a scale of 100mV per Amp.
